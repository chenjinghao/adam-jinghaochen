## Little store about me

When I got my driver's license, I was scared to drive because I was not confident in my driving skills. My dad saw that, and he told me something when I was stopped at a red light:

> **How much petrol you burn is equal to how good your driving skill is! So drive more!**
> 

Like any other dad, he taught me many life lessons, but this is the only one I remember. 

This guided me through difficult situations; I always told myself to try harder so I could find a better solution or practice more to master the skills.

### About the cat on top

When you saw the cat photo at the top of the page, you probably guessed that I’m a cat person—and you’d be right! I have a cat, and one of my favourite things is watching her lock her gaze on a target. She’ll analyze its movements, take in her surroundings, and patiently wait for the perfect moment. When that moment comes, she darts forward, focused and fast, to catch her target.

This, in many ways, mirrors how I approach my goals. I like to define them clearly, analyze what’s needed to achieve them, and, once I have a solid plan, move swiftly and decisively to achieve them.
